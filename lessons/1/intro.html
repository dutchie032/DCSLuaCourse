                    Welcome to my Lua course. <br/>
        
                    With this course I hope to get many of you from absolute beginners and maybe even without any knowledge of code to start writing and understanding your DCS scripts. <br/>
                    Even if you already know how to code this might be a nice way to get into Lua. <br/>
                    The course is divided into chapters. Each chapter will also have a video, but you can also read along here. <br/>
        
                    We'll go over the very basics all the way to more complex concepts that are specific for DCS.

                        Lua was designed as a lightweight, efficient and embeddable language. <br/>
                        It is used a lot in the gaming world, however it is not only used here. 
                        There's medical products I know use it as well to customise parts of the core products for instance for specific countries, vendors etcetera.
                        <br/>
                        For DCS Specifically it can be an extension of the mission editor, since when making missions the Mission Editor can sometimes have it's limits. <br/>
                        Very big multiplayer, event driven or special missions can be incredibly hard to accomplish through only the flag system. <br/>
                        On top of that maintaining it can be even a lot worse. One change and you need to go over a lot of trigggers. <br/>
                        With scripts you can "generalise" and make it work for a lot more usecases. <br/>
                        There's a lot of scripts out there already, but sometimes being able to write our own is the difference between a mission you could like and the mission you love to make!

                        Like mentioned earlier the goal of this course is to learn you how to code in Lua. <br/>
                        And to an extension to learn you how to utilise it in DCS as it can be an incredibly powerful tool. <br/>
                        I'll do this by guiding you through all the features Lua has to offer. <br/>
                        I built this website to make it easily accessible, free and also to make it possible to add a lot of nice ways to help you learn. <br/>
                        Videos will be added as they are created. I am a better programmer than I am a video creator. Patience is key. <br/>
                        What I did add though is way to write, highlight and test your code. <br/>
                        A huge shoutout to <a href="https://onecompiler.com">onecompiler</a> that makes this possible. Read more about them and their goals on their website! <br/>
                        You will however not get any intellisense (which helps a lot in an IDE.), but sometimes it's good to learn without it! <br/>
                        As to how it works practically: <br/>
                        First you can go over the assignment and try to understand what is asked. <br/>
                        You will write code and you'll see the highlights as you'd normally see in your IDE. These help a lot when writing your code. <br/>
                        Once you think you've captured all the requirements you can hit "test" and all test cases are ran. <br/>
                        You'll get real-time feedback on your code and if it passed all the tests or not. <br/>
                    </p>

                    <p class="text">
                        All we need to do is start! <br/>
                        We'll start with the very basics, but you're free to skip ahead. <br/>
                        If you don't have any experience writing code, no worries, this is just the course for you! <br/>
